# CS173-Computer-Vison-I
For course CS173.
## Project 1 Image Hybrid
Easy stuff. Just use simple Gaussian and Laplacian filter and then combine two images together.
Matlab code

## Project 2 Image Stitching
Use traditional SIFT feature method for three affine transformed images. There is also homography methods realized.
Matlab code

## Project 3 Image Classification
